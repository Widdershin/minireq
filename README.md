# minireq

A minimal request library built on XMLHTTPRequest for the browser.

## Why not fetch, axios or superagent

`fetch` is too bare bones and also does not support features like progress indication. `axios` and `superagent` are neither minimal nor are they written with ES modules with makes them akward to bundle.

Also I want a request library with better types than currently available.
